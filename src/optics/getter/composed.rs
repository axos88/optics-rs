/// Creates a `Getter<S,A>` combined from two optics <S, I>, <I, A> applied one after another.
///
/// This struct is automatically created by composing two existing optics, and is **not** intended
/// to be directly constructed outside the crate. Instead, it is generated through composition of
/// two optics via the corresponding `compose_with_XXX` methods, where the two optics can be of any
/// valid optic type that results in a `Getter`.
///
/// # Type Parameters
/// - `S`: The source type of the first optic
/// - `A`: The target type of the second optic
/// - `I`: The intermediate type: the target type of the first optic and the source type of the second optic
///
/// # Arguments
/// - `g1`: The first optic of type `Getter<S, I>`
/// - `g2`: The second optic of type `Getter<I, A>`
///
/// This struct **should not** be manually constructed by users. Instead, it is created via
/// composition of two optics using the appropriate `compose_with_XXX` methods on each optic impl.
/// The `ComposedGetter` structure is provided internally by the crate after you compose valid optics.
///
/// # See Also
